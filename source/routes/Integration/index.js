        <p>Our apps will almost always involve some sort of integration with either the Everydayhero or JustGiving platforms, which can range from a simple link to a registration form, to fetching and displaying leaderboard data, to custom registration flows that leveraging the relevant API.</p>
        <h3>Supporticon</h3>
        <p><a href='https://github.com/everydayhero/supporticon'>Supporticon</a> is our library for handling these integrations. It started out as a library to standardise some calls to the EDH API, but now aims to standardise the EDH and JG APIs where possible.</p>
        <p>For example, after telling it which platform you are using, calling a function like <span className='highlight'>fetchLeaderboard</span>, will make the call to the relevant API, and return the leaders in a standard format, regardless of platform.</p>
        <p>Similar to Prismic content, fetching data from the API and storing in our Redux store is a common task, so supporticon has some helpers for that.</p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>Supporticon also contains a number of data-driven <a href='https://everydayhero.github.io/supporticon/components/'>components</a>, composed of Constructicon components, that can be easily dropped into projects, as shown below.</p>
