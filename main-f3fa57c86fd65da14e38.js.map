For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject$1(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n   @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n  @param {Function} onRejected\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n  /**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n  }\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n  findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n  // something went wrong\n  }\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n  // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n    try/catch/finally behaves\n  \n    Synchronous example:\n  \n    ```js\n    findAuthor() {\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n        throw new Error();\n      }\n      return new Author();\n    }\n  \n    try {\n      return findAuthor();

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject$1(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else

deployment. As we are creating isomorphic JavaScript apps, the output of our build will contain the following.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>server.js</span>: this is the compiled version of our project's server.js</li>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>main.js</span>: this is the compiled version of our project's client.js</li>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>main.css</span>: any imported CSS such as our CSS reset</li>\n          <li>Other assets such as images and fonts</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Note that if we run the build and <span className='highlight'>NODE_ENV=production</span>, there are a couple of small differences, mainly that our main js and css files will include a hash in the filename, which is used to ensure browsers don't cache old versions.</p>\n        <h3>Build Scripts</h3>\n        <p>Our build related scripts will look something like the following. The base <span className='highlight'>build</span> script is used as a baseline, whereas <span className='highlight'>build:staging</span> and <span className='highlight'>build:prod</span> are used to pass in specific environment variables.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='json'>{snippets.buildJson}</CodeBlock>\n        <p>The <span className='highlight'>BASE_PATH</span> variable is used to set the base path that our application is served from, which we use when our app might not be served from the root e.g. when hosted on Github pages.</p>\n        <p>So to build our app for staging, we would run:</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='json'>yarn build:staging</CodeBlock>\n        <p>So to build our app for production, we would run:</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='json'>yarn build:prod</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Static Routes</h3>\n        <p>An important concept in our build is the concept of static routes. In our <span className='highlight'>source/server.js</span>, we often specify routes in <span className='highlight'>app.staticRoutes</span>. A static pre-rendered HTML file will be generated, during the build, for each of these routes.</p>\n        <p>As opposed to other Isomorphic React apps, where a server receives requests and generates HTML at runtime, we are doing that up front during the build, which effectively lets us deploy completely static sites to S3, without having any of the usual overhead of managing a server.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.staticRoutes}</CodeBlock>\n        <p>If we specified the staticRoutes as above, our build would bundle the usual assets, but also render a <span className='highlight'>index.html</span>, <span className='highlight'>about/index.html</span> and <span className='highlight'>faqs/index.html</span>.</p>\n        <p>These generated HTML pages have a couple of important characteristics worth noting.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>They include our <span className='highlight'>main.js</span>, which means our app will load and run in the browser, so subsequent route changes can be handled completely client side</li>\n          <li>The complete state of our Redux store during the build, is serialized into a script tag, which is then reloaded back into the store when it loads in the browser</li>\n        </ul>\n      </Content>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default compose(\n  connect(mapState),\n  provideHooks(hooks)\n)(Build)\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/Build/index.js","export const buildJson = `{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"brb build --config='./webpack.shared.config' --base-path=$BASE_PATH\",\n    \"build:staging\": \"BASE_PATH='/repo-name/' yarn build\",\n    \"build:prod\": \"NODE_ENV='production' yarn build\"\n  }\n}`\n\nexport const staticRoutes = `app.staticRoutes = [\n  '/',\n  '/about',\n  '/faqs'\n]`\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/Build/snippets.js","import React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router'\nimport { provideHooks } from 'redial'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { compose } from 'redux'\nimport * as snippets from './snippets'\n\nimport CodeBlock from '../../components/CodeBlock'\nimport SectionTitle from '../../components/SectionTitle'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport Content from '../../components/Content'\n\nconst hooks = {\n  fetch: ({\n    dispatch,\n    state\n  }) => Promise.all([])\n}\n\nconst mapState = () => ({})\n\nconst Components = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Helmet title='Components | Services Engineering' />\n      <SectionTitle size={5}>Components</SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        <p>Components describe a discrete portion of the UI, by colocating all the requirements in a single place, including behaviour, logic, styles, images, tests etc. This allows us to compose our UI from modular, and potentially reusable, components.</p>\n        <h3>Stateless Components</h3>\n        <p>Often referred to as functional components, as they are functions that simply take props as an argument, and returns an instance of the component, which will contain other React components, possibly representing DOM elements.</p>\n        <p>These are the most common type of component we use.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.statelessComponent}</CodeBlock>\n        <p>The above component is a function that takes a single prop (children), which we are using to ES6 destructuring to assign to a variable, and it returns a h1 with the supplied copy.

This state should never be important to other parts of our application, and should only be used for storing simple UI state that we can afford to lose. We define these as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component base class.</p>\n        <p>A good example of this might be if we have a toggle to show or hide a menu.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.statefulComponent}</CodeBlock>\n        <p>We can also use these when we need to hook into React component lifecycle methods, such as <span className='highlight'>componentDidMount</span> or <span className='highlight'>componentWillReceiveProps</span>.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.lifecycleMethods}</CodeBlock>\n        <h5>Use Case</h5>\n        <ul>\n          <li>When we need to keep simple UI state</li>\n          <li>When we need to hook into component lifecycle methods</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Connected Components</h3>\n        <p>These are components that connect to your Redux store. This can allow a component to receive up-to-date data from the store, and can also prepare our action creators to be able to dispatch actions.</p>\n        <p>These are used to connect sections of our UI to our store, and we will cover this in more detail in our <Link to='/store'>Store</Link> section.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.connectedComponent}</CodeBlock>\n        <h5>Use Case</h5>\n        <ul>\n          <li>When we need to access data from the store</li>\n          <li>When we need to connect our action creators</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Higher Order Components (HOC)</h3>\n        <p>This is a pattern for re-using component logic. Put simply, a HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component.</p>\n        <p>For example, we were constantly writing stateful components that had the toggle functionality show above, so we abstracted it into a HOC, which can be seen <a href='https://github.com/everydayhero/constructicon/blob/master/source/components/with-toggle/index.js'>here</a>.</p>\n        <p>As you can see, this HOC takes a component as an argument, wraps it in a stateful component, which returns the original component with a few extra props to toggle the flag and check the current toggled state. We could refactor our above Menu component to use this HOC.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.higherOrderComponent}</CodeBlock>\n        <p>If you look our connected component example, you will see that it uses <span className='highlight'>connect</span>, which is actually a HOC provided by the react-redux package.</p>\n        <h5>Use Case</h5>\n        <ul>\n          <li>When we need to abstract component logic for reuse</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Constructicon</h3>\n        <p>We have generated a library of re-usable components which we use extensively in our services projects, called <a href='https://everydayhero.github.io/constructicon/'>Constructicon</a>. The docs show each of the available components and the props they take.</p>\n        <p>They range from simple components, like a <span className='highlight'>Button</span> or <span className='highlight'>Section</span>, through to more fundraising specific ones like <span className='highlight'>Leaderboard</span>.</p>\n        <p>It is important to note these are all dumb components, that don't handle anything other than taking props and rendering a component. It also exports some handy utilities and higher order components.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.constructiconExample}</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Resources</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href='https://reactjs.org/'>React</a>: library for building UI</li>\n          <li><a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle'>Component Lifecycle</a>: explanation of available methods</li>\n          <li><a href='https://everydayhero.github.io/constructicon/'>Constructicon</a>: internal library of UI components</li>\n        </ul>\n      </Content>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default compose(\n  connect(mapState),\n  provideHooks(hooks)\n)(Components)\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/Components/index.js","export const statelessComponent = `import React from 'react'\n\nconst Title = ({ children }) => <h1>{children}</h1>\n\nexport default Title`\n\nexport const statelessComponent2 = `import React from 'react'\nimport Title from 'path/to/Title'\n\nconst Content = ({\n  title,\n  copy\n}) => (\n  <div>\n    <Title>{title}</Title>\n    <div>{copy}</div>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Content`\n\nexport const statefulComponent = `import React from 'react'\n\nclass Menu extends React.Component {\n  constructor () {\n    super()\n    this.toggleMenu = this.toggleMenu.bind(this)\n    this.state = {\n      toggled: false\n    }\n  }\n\n  toggleMenu () {\n    this.setState({\n      toggled: !this.state.toggled\n    })\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={this.toggleMenu}>\n          {this.state.toggled ?

Prismic Utils has an abstraction for being able to create Redux action creators and reducers for fetching Prismic documents. The below example is a common example of what you will see in many projects.</p>\n        <p>Under the hook, it is fetching document(s), and using redux-thunk to dispatch actions as it does so.

This method creates a Lambda, uploads it to S3, and creates a Cloudformation script that configures API Gateway and sets up our lambda.</p>\n        <p>Any requests to the site will be forwarded to the Lambda, which is running our app, and will return dynamically generated HTML, as opposed to the statically generated HTML we were using in the earlier methods.</p>\n        <p>Configuring a domain name for these sites requires similar steps to above i.e. an SSL certificate and Cloudfront distribution.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='shell'>brb deploy --target=lambda --bucket=bucket-name --fn-name=myAppNameProd</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Automating via Buildkite</h3>\n        <p>Our app is setup to build and deploy from the command line, but usually, we want to automate this using a CI tool, in our case Buildkite. We do this for a couple of reasons:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Deploying manually is prone to mistakes</li>\n          <li>Eliminates the need for us to have active AWS credentials on our machines</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>When Boilermaker generated our app, it would have included the necessary files that will be used by Buildkite to make up our pipeline.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>.buildkite/pipeline.yml</span>: these are the steps of our pipeline</li>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>bin/test and bin/deploy</span>: these are the actual scripts that the pipeline will execute</li>\n          <li><span className='highlight'>docker-compose.yml</span>: details of the docker container our app will run in</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>To create the pipeline in Buildkite, we need to do a few steps.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Login using the credentials in 1Password</li>\n          <li>Create a new pipeline specifying the name and Github repo of our project</li>\n          <li>Add the necessary environment variables, which include the <span className='highlight'>APP_NAME</span> and the necessary AWS credentials.</li>\n          <li>Tell Buildkite to look at our pipeline config in our codebase, by adding <span className='highlight'>buildkite-agent pipeline upload</span></li>\n          <li>Configure our Github webhooks following the necessary instructions</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>And that's it, when our repo is updated, the pipeline will run the tests, and deploy to staging and production. Although Boilermaker gives us a good baseline, we can configure our pipeline as needed.</p>\n        <h3>Prismic Webhooks</h3>\n        <p>The last thing we may wish to do is configure Prismic to trigger a Buildkite build to re-deploy the site when changes are made in the CMS.</p>\n        <p>This uses by adding a Prismic webhook that will notify <a href='https://github.com/everydayhero/soundwave'>Soundwave</a>, which is an small internal app that listens to webhooks and triggers builds.</p>\n        <p>Details of how to configure the webhook can be found in the Soundwave readme.</p>\n      </Content>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default compose(\n  connect(mapState),\n  provideHooks(hooks)\n)(Deploy)\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/Deploy/index.js","import React from 'react'\nimport { provideHooks } from 'redial'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { compose } from 'redux'\nimport * as snippets from './snippets'\n\nimport CodeBlock from '../../components/CodeBlock'\nimport SectionTitle from '../../components/SectionTitle'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport Content from '../../components/Content'\n\nconst hooks = {\n  fetch: ({\n    dispatch,\n    state\n  }) => Promise.all([])\n}\n\nconst mapState = () => ({})\n\nconst GettingStarted = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Helmet title='Getting Started | Services Engineering' />\n      <SectionTitle size={5}>Getting Started</SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>\n        <p><a href='https://github.com/everydayhero/boilermaker'>Boilermaker</a> is an internal tool for quickly bootstrapping new projects.

This route config is passed into Boiler Room Runner in our <span className='highlight'>client.js</span> and <span className='highlight'>server.js</span>.</p>\n        <p>The wrapping route allows us to define a site wide header and footer in a SiteContainer component.

Redux manages the state (data) of our application in a single immutable source. It is important to understand the concepts of how we access and manipulate this state, and to understand that Redux is a simple concept at it's core.</p>\n        <h3>State</h3>\n        <p>This refers to the current state of your application, which is represented in an immutable object.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.state}</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Actions</h3>\n        <p>To make changes to the state, you need to dispatch an action, which is a plain object that describes the change. An action contains a <span className='highlight'>type</span>, which describes the type of action, and usually a <span className='highlight'>payload</span>, which provide extra information about the action.</p>\n        <p>Actions are generally dispatched via action creators, which are simply functions that return these actions.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.action}</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Reducers</h3>\n        <p>A reducer is a function that can modify our state by listening to actions that have been dispatched, and returns the new state of the app.</p>\n        <p>A reducer function takes two arguments every time an action is dispatched, the current state of the application, and the action that was dispatched. A reducer will then determine if it needs to make a change to the state, and either a) return the current state if no change is required or b) return the updated state.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.reducer}</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Middleware</h3>\n        <p>Redux middleware allows you to extend this flow, by hooking into actions before they are passed through the reducer.</p>\n        <p>A middleware we commonly use is <span className='highlight'>redux-thunk</span>, which allows us to handle asynchronous operations. Usually an action is a plain object, but if your action is a function, redux-thunk will call that action and provide <span className='highlight'>dispatch</span> as an argument, meaning you can dispatch multiple actions in a single action creator.</p>\n        <p>The example below is an asynchronous example of our earlier addUser example, in this case it will fire an action to indicate it will make the request, and then either a success or failure action depending on whether the request was successful.</p>\n        <CodeBlock type='javascript'>{snippets.thunk}</CodeBlock>\n        <h3>Connecting Components</h3>\n        <p>We mentioned in the Components section, that we can create connected components, which are able to interact with our Redux store.
